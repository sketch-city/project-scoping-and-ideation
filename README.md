# project-scoping-and-ideation



1. Decompose the problem 
2. Generate problem-solution pairs and for-each:
* Threshold on complexity (can I do this?)
* Threshold on impact (should I do this? i.e. is this really a problem?)
3. Write the problem statement - get specific!


How to search (for anything)
* Can I learn? (adopt a growth model)
* Understand basic procedures (how to search)


|A well scoped project | A poorly scoped project|
|---|---|
|Client & team have a shared understanding of what needs to be done| No client has been identified|
|Research done, impact and complexity of project are known | No research for impact or complexity|
| Project timeline can be created with major and medium milestones | No (or vague) timeline |
|Verified users | No users identified or verified |
|Team understands existing resources, skills, & gaps | No team has been formed, skills resources and gaps unknown|
| Success criteria are known and agreed upon | No success criteria identified |
| Budget is known, accounted for & balanced | No budget, no funding source|
| Documentation is part of the project plan| Documentation has not been done (not planned, deferred)|
|Plan to manage data (open data plan where possible) | No data plan |
| Project on track to be completed | Project may not finish (or start |
| Team and client have researched existing solutions, existing failures and opportunities for new solutions | Neither team nor client has any idea of existing solutions or failures |


With a well-scoped project, you can proceed in good faith and arrive at something that solves a real problem.

Your team and client will have a shared vocabulary and a framework for making and measuring progress on the project effectively and efficiently.
